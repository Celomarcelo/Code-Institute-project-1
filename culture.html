    <p>Knowing Italian traditions is crucial for fully understanding various Brazilian social and cultural aspects, after all, Brazil is one of the countries with the most Italian immigrants in the world. Currently, almost 35 million Italian-Brazilians live in green-yellow lands. Due to the importance of this influence, National Italian Immigrant Day gained a date: February 21st, the day on which the Steamboat “La Sofia” docked in Brazil with the first families coming directly from the country of the boot.</p>
    <p>National Italian Immigrant Day is also a great emotional milestone in the hearts of Italian descendants. It’s the story of many families.</p>
    <p>With so many immigrants, Italian customs are here to stay. Among the main traditions that have become popular among Brazilians are gastronomy, architecture, language, festivals and family culture. Find out more about the history of each of these items in the list we have prepared for you.</p>

    <h4>Gastronomy</h4>
    <p>Many dishes have Italian origins, such as gnocchi, fettuccine, pizza, lasagna and many other delicacies. Furthermore, it was only after immigration that vegetables and corn began to be grown to make cornmeal in backyards for family consumption and sale. The use of sausages, such as pepperoni and mortadella, also comes from the Italians.</p>

    <h4>Family</h4>
    <p>In the Italian tradition, family is much more than just father, mother and children. It extends to uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents, dogs, cats and parrots. Furthermore, families have the habit of getting together frequently, in meetings accompanied by lots of food and, of course, good wine.</p>

    <h4>Architecture</h4>
    <p>The ships that arrived from Italy came not only with workers, but also builders, who brought with them Italian architectural ideals: narrow houses, made of stone or wood. This style of architecture is very present in the south of Brazil, mainly.</p>

    <h4>Language</h4>
    <p>One of the traditions maintained by Italians here in Brazil is the famous “tchau”, which comes from the word “Ciao”, used in Italy as an informal greeting. Other words of Italian origin are: alarm, artisan, banquet, cascade, feast, gazette, maestro, mafia, panettone, polenta, sonnet, trampoline and violin. And we still have “Talian”, a language officially recognized in Brazil, which is widely spoken in the Italian colonies of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.</p>

 <div>
    <h4>Festivals</h4>
    <p>In the traditional festivals that take place in different cities in Brazil, it is possible to celebrate Italian culture through music, dance, religion, cuisine and lots of conversation. Some examples are: Festitália de Blumenau, in Santa Catarina, the Festa de Nossa Senhora Achiropita, in São Paulo, the Italian Traditional Festival of Belo Horizonte, in Minas Gerais, and the National Grape Festival of Caxias do Sul, in Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
