    <div class="introduction">
    <p>Most of the Italians who migrated to Brazil were of humble origins, mainly from rural regions of Italy. Brazil was seen as a new land, full of opportunities. It is worth remembering that Italy was going through an employment crisis in the second half of the 19th century, generated mainly by the country's industrialization. The high population growth was not accompanied by the country's economic growth and the creation of new jobs, causing many Italians to choose life in other countries (Brazil, United States, Argentina, France, Switzerland, among others).
If on the one hand Italy had many people wanting to look for work in other countries, Brazil needed labor. After the Abolition of Slavery (1888), farmers opted for labor of European origin, instead of integrating former slaves into the labor market. The Brazilian government itself campaigned in Italy to attract these Italians to work on Brazilian farms.</p>
    <p>Italian immigration to Brazil peaked in the period between 1880 and 1930. Italian-Brazilians are spread mainly across the states of the South and Southeast of Brazil. Italian-Brazilians are descendants of the enormous mass of Italian immigrants who arrived in Brazil between 1870 and 1960.</p>

    <div class="where-to-go">
        <h2>And where to go?</h2>
        <p>It is likely that almost 4 million Italians went to Brazil between 1884 and 1939. As they were white and Catholic, Italian immigrants were treated differently from former black slaves, but the quality of life was not higher than what was promised.</p>
        <p>With precarious working conditions and the difficult mentality of farmers, the General Commissariat of Emigration in Italy prohibited subsidized emigration to Brazil in 1902 through the Prinetti Decree.
            The Italians who arrived in São Paulo came mainly from southern Italy and were almost all peasants. They went to work, mainly, on coffee plantations in the interior and in industries in the capital. Many of them managed to get rich and prosper in São Paulo, as was the case with the famous Matarazzo family.
            The Italians who went to the south of Brazil not only worked on growing grapes for wine production, but also formed large colonies. Many of these colonies still exist today, such as the city of Farroupilha, in Serra Gaúcha.</p>

        <h2>Italian culture in Brazil</h2>
        <p>The Italians who came to live in Brazil brought with them many cultural characteristics that were incorporated into Brazilian culture, remaining present to this day. Among the countless Italian contributions to Brazilian culture, we can mention new agricultural techniques, the use of “tchau” (ciao) throughout Brazil, dishes that were incorporated, such as pizza, spaghetti (spaghetti) and the habit of eating panettone (panettone) in Christmas, the rooting of Catholicism, incorporating Italian elements into Brazilian religion, etc.</p>

    <div class="nowadays">
        <h2>Nowadays</h2>
        <p>Currently the Italian community in Brazil represents approximately 15% of the population, with 30 million people.</p>
        <p>It is the second largest Italian community in the world.</p>
        <p>3.2 million Italians and descendants live in Rio Grande do Sul, representing around 30% of the state's population.​</p>
        <p>Santa Catarina has 3.7 million Italians and descendants, representing around 60% of the Santa Catarina population.</p>
        <p>Paraná has 4.1 million Italians and descendants, representing around 40% of the state's population.​</p>
        <p>The State of São Paulo received 70% of all Italian immigrants and today has around 12 million Italians and descendants, representing 30% of the population.</p>
        <p>The city of São Paulo has around 11 million inhabitants, of which 6 million are Italians or descendants, that is, approximately 55% of the city's population are of Italian origin. To get an idea of ​​this large percentage in the city of São Paulo, it is interesting to compare it with the largest city in Italy – Rome, which currently has around 2.5 million Italians, fewer Italians than the capital of São Paulo.</p>
        <p>1.5 million people of Italian descent live in Minas Gerais, representing around 8% of the state's population.</p>
        <p>600,000 Italians and descendants live in Rio de Janeiro, representing around 4% of the state's population.</p>
